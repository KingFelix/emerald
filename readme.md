## About

Redmerald is a theme based on [Jacopo Rabolini](http://www.jacoporabolini.com)'s [Emerald](https://github.com/KingFelix/emerald/)

## Setup & usage

The [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com) is the best starting point, if you haven't read it yet.

Because Redmerald is based on another theme, you may want to read the [original documentation](https://github.com/KingFelix/emerald/blob/master/readme.md)

Simply download the .zip folder from the [repository on Github](https://github.com/Vesuvium/redmerald/archive/master.zip).

After extracting the content from the folder into the selected directory, you can type ``jekyll serve`` from the terminal, than open your browser to ``0.0.0.0:4000/emerald/`` and you will find it there.

It is also possible to fork the repository and use Github Pages as hosting.

You will have to change the ``baseurl`` value into the ``_config.yml`` file, with the directory name of your project (for example /blog) or simply with a "/" (slash) if you want install Redmerald in the root.
